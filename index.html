        <h2>Solar system</h2>
        <p>The solar system is a vast collection of celestial bodies. It consists of the sun, eight planets, and various smaller objects. The sun is at the center of the solar system, providing heat and light. The planets orbit the sun in elliptical paths. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, while Neptune is the farthest. Each planet has unique characteristics and features. The solar system also includes dwarf planets like Pluto. Moons orbit around some of the planets, such as Earth's moon. Asteroids and comets are also part of the solar system. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago. It originated from a giant molecular cloud. Gravity plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the solar system. The solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy. It is just one of the billions of star systems in the universe. Scientists continue to explore and study the solar system. Understanding the solar system helps us comprehend our place in the cosmos.</p>

            <h2>The sun</h2>
            <p>The sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas. It is located at the center of the solar system. The sun's diameter is about 1.4 million kilometers. It is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. The sun's surface temperature is around 5,500 degrees Celsius. Energy is produced in the sun's core through nuclear fusion. The sun emits light and heat through a process called radiation. Sunspots, dark areas on the sun's surface, are cooler regions. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are powerful eruptions on the sun. The sun's gravity holds the planets in their orbits. It also influences the behavior of comets and asteroids. The sun's energy is essential for life on Earth. It provides warmth and enables photosynthesis in plants. The sun's activity follows an 11-year cycle. During solar maximum, sunspots and solar flares are more frequent. Studying the sun helps us understand other stars in the universe.</p>
