        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is an ice giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky. The planet has a diameter of about 51,118 kilometers, making it the third-largest planet in our solar system. Uranus is known for its unique feature of rotating on its side, with its axis tilted at an angle of about 98 degrees. This extreme axial tilt gives Uranus its distinct appearance and causes its seasons to be significantly different from other planets. Uranus has a pale blue color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. The planet has a total of 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Uranus has a faint ring system, consisting of 13 known rings. The rings are composed of dark particles, possibly made up of organic compounds. Uranus has a relatively calm atmosphere, with fewer visible cloud features compared to other gas giants. The planet experiences strong winds, reaching speeds of up to 900 kilometers per hour. Uranus has a weak magnetic field compared to other gas giants, but it is still significant. The magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's axis of rotation, causing it to be off-center. Uranus has a relatively low average temperature, reaching as low as -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit). The planet's interior is believed to consist of a rocky core surrounded by layers of icy materials and gases. Uranus has a relatively low density, which suggests the presence of a large amount of water in its composition. The Voyager 2 spacecraft, launched by NASA in 1977, is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus. It flew by the planet in 1986, providing valuable data and images of its atmosphere, rings, and moons. Uranus has a long orbital period, taking about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The planet's distance from the Sun varies between 2.7 billion and 3 billion kilometers. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The study of Uranus helps scientists better understand the formation and evolution of ice giants in our solar system. Uranus has a relatively low gravity, about 89% of Earth's gravity. The planet's rings are relatively narrow and dark, making them difficult to observe from Earth. Uranus has a faint and incomplete ring system, consisting of 13 known rings. The rings are composed of small particles, ranging in size from dust grains to boulder-sized objects. Uranus has a complex system of moons, with some displaying unusual characteristics, such as irregular shapes and heavily cratered surfaces. The study of Uranus' moons provides insights into the formation and evolution of the Uranian system. Uranus has a relatively calm and featureless atmosphere, with few visible cloud formations. The planet's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane. Uranus experiences extreme seasons due to its axial tilt, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus has a relatively low internal heat, which contributes to its cold temperatures. The planet's magnetic field is generated by electrical currents within its icy mantle. Uranus has a faint and incomplete ring system, consisting of 13 known rings. The rings are composed of dark particles, possibly made up of organic compounds. The study of Uranus' rings provides insights into the dynamics of ring systems and the processes of planet formation.</p>
