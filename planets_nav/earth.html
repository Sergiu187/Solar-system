        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and a circumference of approximately 40,075 kilometers. Earth is the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of ecosystems, including forests, deserts, oceans, and grasslands. The Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is about 71% covered by water, with the remaining 29% consisting of land. Earth has a natural satellite called the Moon, which orbits around it. The Earth's rotation on its axis causes day and night. It takes approximately 365.25 days for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, resulting in a leap year every four years. Earth experiences four seasons due to its axial tilt. The planet's magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation. Earth is home to a vast array of plant and animal species, many of which are still undiscovered. The Earth's oceans contain about 97% of the planet's water. The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, located in the Himalayas, with an elevation of 8,848 meters. The lowest point on Earth is the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, reaching a depth of about 11,034 meters. Earth's climate is influenced by factors such as latitude, altitude, and proximity to large bodies of water. The Earth's crust is divided into several tectonic plates that constantly move and interact, leading to earthquakes and volcanic activity. The planet has a rich geological history, with evidence of past ice ages, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains. Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and supporting life through the greenhouse effect. The Earth's natural resources, such as minerals, fossil fuels, and freshwater, are essential for human civilization. Human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change, pose significant threats to the Earth's ecosystems. Earth is part of the broader universe and is located in the Milky Way galaxy. The study of Earth and its processes is known as geology. Earth's diverse cultures and civilizations have flourished for thousands of years, leaving behind a rich heritage of art, literature, and scientific discoveries. As the only known habitable planet, Earth is a precious and fragile home that requires our care and stewardship.</p>
