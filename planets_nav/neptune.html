        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant, similar in composition to Uranus. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. The planet has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers, making it the fourth-largest planet by diameter. Neptune has a bluish color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has a total of 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most notable. Triton is unique among the large moons in the solar system because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction. Neptune has a faint and incomplete ring system, consisting of five main rings. The planet has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Neptune experiences extremely high wind speeds, with the fastest recorded winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. The Great Dark Spot, a large storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, was observed on Neptune but has since disappeared. Neptune has a strong magnetic field, about 27 times stronger than Earth's. The planet's magnetic field is tilted relative to its axis of rotation, causing it to have a magnetic north and south pole that are not aligned with its geographic poles. Neptune has a complex weather system, with large-scale storms and cloud formations. The planet's interior is believed to consist of a rocky core surrounded by a thick layer of icy materials and gases. Neptune's gravity is about 17% stronger than Earth's gravity. The planet's average temperature is extremely cold, reaching as low as -218 degrees Celsius (-360 degrees Fahrenheit). Voyager 2, a NASA spacecraft, is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. It flew by the planet in 1989, providing valuable data and images of its atmosphere, rings, and moons. Neptune's orbit is highly elliptical, taking about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The planet's distance from the Sun varies between 4.4 billion and 4.5 billion kilometers. Neptune's discovery was based on mathematical predictions before it was actually observed through a telescope. The study of Neptune helps scientists better understand the dynamics and formation of gas giants in our solar system. The planet's atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrocarbons, giving it a distinct blue color. Neptune's rings are composed of small particles of dust and ice. The planet's interior is under extreme pressure, causing the icy materials to behave like a fluid. Neptune's moon Triton has a thin atmosphere and geysers that erupt nitrogen gas. The planet's magnetic field is tilted at an angle of about 47 degrees relative to its axis of rotation. Neptune's atmosphere exhibits cloud bands and storms, including the formation of bright white clouds. The planet's blue color is due to the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere. Neptune's rings are relatively young compared to the rings of other gas giants. The planet's interior is believed to contain a layer of hot, dense fluid made up of water, ammonia, and methane. Neptune's moon Triton is gradually moving closer to the planet and is expected to be torn apart by tidal forces in the distant future. The study of Neptune's moons provides insights into the formation and evolution of the outer solar system.</p>
