    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It is located closest to the Sun. Mercury has a diameter of about 4,879 kilometers, making it slightly larger than Earth's Moon. The planet is named after the Roman messenger god, known for his speed. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, almost negligible, and is mostly composed of helium and traces of other gases. It has a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Moon. Mercury has a high temperature range, with scorching hot temperatures during the day and freezing cold temperatures at night. It takes about 88 Earth days for Mercury to complete one orbit around the Sun. Mercury has a slow rotation, with one day on Mercury lasting about 59 Earth days. The planet has no moons or rings. Mercury's surface is covered in various types of terrain, including smooth plains, rugged mountains, and deep craters. The Caloris Basin is one of the largest impact craters on Mercury, spanning about 1,550 kilometers in diameter. Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) and nighttime temperatures dropping to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius). The planet's proximity to the Sun causes it to have a highly elliptical orbit. Mercury has a weak magnetic field, about 1% of Earth's magnetic field strength. The planet's surface is rich in various elements, including iron, sulfur, and other metals. Mercury has been visited by only one spacecraft, NASA's MESSENGER mission, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015, providing valuable data about its composition and geology. The surface of Mercury is scarred by numerous impact craters, indicating a history of intense bombardment. The planet's thin atmosphere allows solar radiation and solar wind to directly impact its surface. Mercury's proximity to the Sun makes it difficult to observe from Earth due to the Sun's glare. The planet's surface is covered in a layer of fine dust and regolith. Mercury has a relatively high density, indicating a large iron core. The planet's gravity is about 38% of Earth's gravity. Mercury has a unique orbit that exhibits a phenomenon called "resonance," where it completes three rotations on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun. The planet's surface is heavily cratered, suggesting a lack of geological activity. Mercury's surface is marked by long, winding cliffs known as "scarps," believed to be the result of the planet's cooling and contraction. The study of Mercury provides insights into the early formation and evolution of rocky planets. The planet's proximity to the Sun makes it a challenging destination for space missions due to the extreme heat and gravitational pull. Mercury's thin atmosphere allows for the escape of gases into space. The planet's surface is constantly bombarded by micrometeoroids and solar particles.</p>
