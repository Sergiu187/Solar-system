        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a diameter of about 143,000 kilometers, making it more than 11 times larger than Earth. The planet has a distinctive banded appearance, with alternating light and dark bands of clouds. Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. It is so large that Earth could fit inside it more than 1,300 times. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, which is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. The planet has a total of 79 known moons, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, is even bigger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter has a rapid rotation, completing one day in less than 10 hours. The planet's atmosphere is known for its high-speed winds, reaching speeds of up to 600 kilometers per hour. Jupiter experiences intense storms and lightning activity. The planet's core is believed to be a dense, rocky material surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen. Jupiter's gravity is so strong that it can significantly affect the orbits of other nearby celestial bodies. The Juno spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2011, has been studying Jupiter since 2016, providing valuable insights into its composition and structure. Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, indicating that it has an internal heat source. The planet's immense size and gravity make it a natural shield, protecting the inner solar system from potential comet and asteroid impacts. Jupiter's rings, although faint, are composed of small particles of dust and rock. The planet's auroras, similar to Earth's northern and southern lights, are caused by charged particles interacting with its magnetic field. Jupiter's immense mass causes it to have a significant influence on the overall dynamics of the solar system. The planet's name comes from the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods. Jupiter has been observed by astronomers for centuries and was known to ancient civilizations. The first detailed observations of Jupiter were made by Galileo Galilei in the early 17th century. Jupiter's immense size and gravitational pull make it a popular target for space missions and exploration. Studying Jupiter helps scientists better understand the formation and evolution of our solar system.</p>
